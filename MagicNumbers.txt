1. Magic Numbers.
E.G 
Number= 50113 
=> 5+0+1+1+3=10 
=> 1+0=1 
This is a Magic Number.
sum of its digits are calculated till a single digit recursively by adding the sum of the digits after every addition. If the single digit comes out to be 1,then the number is a magic number. 
(N%9==1)


2. Happy Numbers.
E.G.
Number = 32
32+ 22 = 13
12 + 32 = 10
12 + 02 = 1
In this example, we split 32 to get the sum of squares of its digits which forms another number (13), we replace 32 by 13 to continue this cycle until result 1. We found 32 a happy number.


3. Duck Numbers.
E.G.
Number = 2012.     - Duck
Number = 0025.     - Not Duck
Number = 2345.     - Not Duck
If given number has zero in between or end, that is call duck nimbet.


4. Spy Numbers.
E.G.
input - 1421
Sum of digits ==> 1+4+2+1 = 8
Product of digits ==> 1*4*2*1 = 8
Since the product and the sum of the digits are exactly the same, the number is a spy number


5 Strong Number
E.G.
A strong number is a number in which the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the number itself.
145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145


6 Perfect Number
E.G.
A perfect number is a number which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
For example, 6 is a perfect number.
The divisors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3.1 + 2 + 3 = 6.


7 Friendly Pair
E.G.
For example,6 (Perfect Number) and 28 (Perfect Number) are Friendly Pair.
(Sum of divisors of 6) is 6 &  (Sum of divisors of 28) is 28.
So these number are Friendly Pair.


8 Automorphic Number
E.G.
An automorphic number is a number whose square ends with the number itself.
For example, 5 is an automorphic number, 5*5 =25.


9 Abdunt Number
E.G.
An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.
The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and sum is 16
16 > 12. Hence, 12 is an abundant number.
